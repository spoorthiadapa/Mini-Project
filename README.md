# Crime Analysis and Prediction against Women
## Definition
It is a Machine Learning project to detect crimes occuring in a city and to find number of crimes based on number of crimes that had happened last 14 years using algorithms.

## Working
-step1: Open jupyter notebook
-step2: Open a new folder
-step3: Install all the packages and insert dataset of crimes
-step4: Run k-means algorith code
-step5: Run linear regression and ARIMA model code 
-step6: Both algorithms predict the next 5 years crimes 
-step7: It gives the better accuracy between both algorithms
